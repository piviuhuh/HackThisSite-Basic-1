# HackThisSite - Basic 1
## Description
Basic test of your skills to see if you can do any of these missions. Requirements: HTML

We will be doing Basic 1 from HackThisSite
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/1/

## Solution
Upon accessing the challenge page, we observe:

`This level is what we call "The Idiot Test", if you can't complete it, don't give up on learning all you can, but, don't go begging to someone else for the answer, thats one way to get you hated/made fun of. Enter the password and you can continue.`

To obtain the password, let's explore the webpage's HTML code, which reveals the building blocks of the page's content. You can access this code by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+U or by right-clicking and choosing View Page Source.

You can find an phrase like this one:
```sh
<!-- the first few levels are extremely easy: password is ****** ->
```
With the password in hand, we can now submit it and move on to the next challenge.

It's a common practice for developers to include temporary comments in their code, which sometimes contain sensitive information that can be accidentally left exposed.

I appreciate you taking the time to review my write-up. If you have any inquiries or comments, please feel free to reach out. See you on the next challenge.
